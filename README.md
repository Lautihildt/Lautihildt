I’m a Data Science student at the University of Buenos Aires, in the early stages of my career, and I’m committed to learning the skills I need to enter the workforce when I feel ready. Currently, I’m learning Python, SQL, and Power BI, with a focus on data analysis and visualization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Python (for data analytics)
  - SQL (through the course "SQL - Complete Database Course - From Zero to Advanced" by Pablo Tilotta)
  - Power BI
- 📚 At university, I’ve already learned Python and deepened my knowledge of SQL through a Udemy course, where I not only mastered the syntax of MySQL but also key concepts like database normalization, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Views, and Transactions. Now, I’m focusing on learning Python for data analytics and expanding my knowledge of Power BI.
- 👯 I’m excited to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to data science, analysis, and visualization.
