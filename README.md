Iâ€™m a Data Science student at the University of Buenos Aires, in the early stages of my career, and Iâ€™m committed to learning the skills I need to enter the workforce when I feel ready. Currently, Iâ€™m learning Python, SQL, and Power BI, with a focus on data analysis and visualization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - Python (for data analytics)
  - SQL (through the course "SQL - Complete Database Course - From Zero to Advanced" by Pablo Tilotta)
  - Power BI
- ðŸ“š At university, Iâ€™ve already learned Python and deepened my knowledge of SQL through a Udemy course, where I not only mastered the syntax of MySQL but also key concepts like database normalization, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Views, and Transactions. Now, Iâ€™m focusing on learning Python for data analytics and expanding my knowledge of Power BI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to data science, analysis, and visualization.
- âœ” If you have any questions or want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out â€” Iâ€™m here to learn and help!
- ðŸ‘¾ When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy hobbies like playing video games, playing handball, listening to music, and reading science books. Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to combine my personal interests with learning and technology!
